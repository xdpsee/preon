      The public API of Limbo. Limo is simple expression language
      offering support for regular arithmetic operators and boolean
      operators. Key difference with other existing expression languages
      is that Limbo tries to offer a rich expression language while
      preserving the ability to generate a human readable representation
      of the expression.
